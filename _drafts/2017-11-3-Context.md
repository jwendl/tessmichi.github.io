It's sometimes fun and always important to take context into account, so here I will describe, at a very high level, my experience in the tech field so far. I'll break it down into two sections: academia, and industry.

# Academia

The school I went to, Drexel University, is very industry focused and experience focused. So, the mentality that students take is very practical, or at least that's how we are taught to approach problems. I took about half of my classes from adjunct professors, which means that they actually work out in the field and only teach one class a term normally. Their perspectives therefore are geared towards practicality and building solutions.

I did of course still have many classes geared towards theory, as my degree was computer science after all. My graduate classes were almost always taking a different perspective. I enjoyed them more because they challenged me more and of course their syllabi were a lot more complex, but I wouldn't have liked not having any classes for programming.

So I'd say that I got a balance of theory and practical development, in content as well as in teaching styles. In college is where I became addicted to learning, because I was never satisfied with just learning what's on the test - I wanted to learn how it works and why it's important. My favorite professor would stay after class for hours and talk with a few of us about computers and consider why the industry moved in certain directions. He also helped instill a mentality that I hope I keep forever by telling his students not to worry about their grades but instead to worry about what they learned. I definitely took this to heard and it is a rule I live by, generalized to all of life instead of just class.

# Industry

While this blog starts with my first job out of college, I did work all through college, spending 21 months out of 5 years working full time and only taking classes part time (well actually for 3 of those months I did both full time but that's beside the point) and the rest of the time working part time and studying full time to get my BS and MS in 5 years.

For 6 months I worked at a financial firm called Susquehanna Investment Group, where the mentality is that the technology department is clearly serving 1 goal which is expanding productivity of the other departments. This is where I learned .net development for the first time. I got to work on some interesting applications, mainly a folder comparison tool for deployment between environments, an activity monitor to ensure servers are up and running, and a tool for users to record certain kinds of trades in our database. At this job, I did not get to collaborate with others on projects but did have them review my code.

For part time, then for my second 6-month coop, then part time again, then full time for 3 months, then part time again, I worked for Brandywine Global Investment Management. This job was very comfortable for me, everybody was really nice and helpful and wanted to see me succeed, and I got used to the flow and how things work quickly. I will definitely stop in and say hi when I visit home for the holidays. Here, I was given a lot more responsibility. The kinds of projects I worked on were more directly involving the business, and I got opportunities to collaborate with others, own solutions, be an expert for some technologies due to working with them a lot, and interview interns and coops for similar positions when the company decided to hire more from Drexel.

For two separate 3 month spouts of full time internships, I worked in Commercial Software Engineering at Microsoft. I had two amazing bosses and bunch of amazing mentors that helped me find my place. For my first summer, I worked on a plugin for visual studio using a library from Microsoft Research which I was not able to share on GitHub. This project was the first time I used unit testing other than in class. I worked with a group of 10 other interns, but only one of them was working on my same project with me. It was a very collaborative environment, and we all loved sharing what we learned with each other and learning from each other as we were all exposed to different kinds of projects and workflows. For my second summer the situation was similar, only there were less of us and I was one of two returning interns so my role was expanded. For this summer, my main project was a bot targeted towards financial reporting; you can read about it [here](https://github.com/tessmichi/fineas). 

My other part time jobs included student assistance, and a term of teaching assistance.
